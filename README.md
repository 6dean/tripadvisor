# TripAdvisor

I have made a replica of a page from <b>TripAdvisor</b>. 
<br/>This is my first time making a page using HTML, CSS and Javascript! ðŸ˜€ 

# Details

<ul>
<li>Header and Pictures are from original TripAdvisor </li>
<li>Polices and icons are from Google Fonts and FontAwesome</li>
<li>I chosen Kochi because I know someone who lives there, it was a tribute and easier for me as beginner</li>
<li>I did this when I was at my Coding Bootcamp</li>

# Bugs and Issues

I am still working on the responsive, the sticky header can be improved and elements clarity in lower resolution also.
